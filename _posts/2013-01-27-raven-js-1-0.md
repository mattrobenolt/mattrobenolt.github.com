If you've used [Raven.js][1] in the past, I'm sorry. It probably didn't work well, and you probably ended up with a ton of strange `Script Error.` logs.

<abbr title="January 27th, 2013">Today</abbr>, I'm excited to announce a full rewrite of [Raven.js][1] with the goal of *actually* making stack traces in JavaScript meaningful.

Throughout this process, I've learned much more about error handling in JavaScript than I've ever wanted to, and in turn, learned how equally terrible it is.

One of the goals with 1.0 is, in general, a much better understanding of *why* things weren't working right and figuring out solutions, either on our end or yours, to make the errors as meaningful as possible.

Also, from this point on, I'm personally committed to making [Raven.js][1] the best tool for debugging client side exceptions, and I encourage [sending me feedback](https://twitter.com/mattrobenolt) and [reporting issues and ideas to make the project better][2]. It's very hard to identify every scenario in every browser alone!

If you are using [GetSentry][4], you can begin trying out the new [Raven.js][1] today. If not, you'll want to upgrade to Sentry 5.3.

I hope you enjoy it!
